                    Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1
              draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-01

Abstract

   This document [if approved] formally deprecates Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1 [RFC4346] and moves
   these documents to the historic state.  These versions lack support
   for current and recommended cipher suites, and various government and
   industry profiiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding
   these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 has been the recommended version for
   IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient time to transition
   away from older versions.  Products having to support older versions
   increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase opportunities
   for misconfigurations.  Supporting these older versions also requires
   additional effort for library and product maintenance.

   This document updates the backward compatibility sections of TLS RFCs
   [[list TBD]] to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1.  This
   document also updates RFC 7525.

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1           July 2018


   Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1
   [RFC4346] were superceded by TLSv1.2 [RFC5246] in 2008, which has now
   itself been superceded by TLSv1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  It is
   therefore timely to further deprecate these old versions.  The
   expection is that TLSv1.2 will continue to be used for many years
   alongside TLSv1.3.

   TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 are also actively being deprecated in accordance
   with guidance from government agencies (e.g.  NIST SP 80052r2
   [NIST800-52r2]) and industry consortia such as the Payment Card
   Industry Association (PCI) [PCI-TLS1].

   The primary technical reasons for deprecating these versions include:

   o  They require implementation of older cipher suites that are no
      longer desirable for cryptographic reasons, e.g.  TLSv1.0 makes
      TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA mandatory to implement
   o  Lack of support for current recommended cipher suites, especially
      using AEAD ciphers which are not supported prior to TLS 1.2.
      Note: registry entries for no-longer-desirable ciphersuites remain
      in the registries, but many TLS registries are being updated
      through [I-D.ietf-tls-iana-registry-updates] which denotes such
      entries as "not recommended."
   o  Integrity of the handshake depends on SHA-1 hash
   o  Authentication of the peers depends on SHA-1 signatures
   o  Support for four protocol versions increases the likelihood of
      misconfiguration
   o  At least one widely-used library has plans to drop TLSv1.1 and
      TLSv1.0 support in upcoming releases; products using such
      libraries would need to use older versions of the libraries to
      support TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, which is clearly undesirable

   Deprecation of these versions is intended to assist developers as
   additional justification to no longer support older TLS versions and
   to migrate to a minimum of TLSv1.2.  Deprecation also assists product
   teams with phasing out support for the older versions to reduce the
   attack surface and the scope of maintenance for protocols in their
   offerings.

   [[This draft is being written now so that the TLS WG chairs can just
   hit the "publication requested" button as soon as there is WG
   consensus to deprecate these ancient versions of TLS.  The authors
   however think that deprecation now is timely.]]

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1           July 2018


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Support for Deprecation

   Industry has actively followed guidance provided by NIST and the PCI
   Council to deprecate TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 by June 30, 2018.  TLSv1.2
   should remain a minimum baseline for TLS support at this time.

   Specific details on attacks against TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 as well as
   their mitigations are provided in NIST SP800-52r2 [NIST800-52r2], RFC
   7457 [RFC7457]  and other referenced RFCs.  Although the attacks have
   been mitigated, if support is dropped for future library releases for
   these versions, it is unlikely attacks found going forward will be
   mitigated in older library releases.

   NIST for example have provided the following rationale, copied with
   permission from NIST SP800-52r2 [NIST800-52r2], section 1.2 "History
   of TLS" (with references changed for RFC formating).

      TLS 1.1, specified in [RFC4346], was developed to address
      weaknesses discovered in TLS 1.0, primarily in the areas of
      initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
      Initialization vectors were made explicit to prevent a certain
      class of attacks on the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
      operation used by TLS.  The handling of padding errors was altered
      to treat a padding error as a bad message authentication code,
      rather than a decryption failure.  In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC
      acknowledges attacks on CBC mode that rely on the time to compute
      the message authentication code (MAC).  The TLS 1.1 specification
      states that to defend against such attacks, an implementation must
      process records in the same manner regardless of whether padding
      errors exist.  Further implementation considerations for CBC modes
      (which were not included in RFC4346 [RFC4346]) are discussed in
      Section 3.3.2.

      TLS 1.2, specified in RFC5246 [RFC5246], made several
      cryptographic enhancements, particularly in the area of hash
      functions, with the ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family
      algorithms for hash, MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF)
      computations.  TLS 1.2 also adds authenticated encryption with
      associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1           July 2018


      TLS 1.3, specified in TLSv1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], represents a
      significant change to TLS that aims to address threats that have
      arisen over the years.  Among the changes are a new handshake
      protocol, a new key derivation process that uses the HMAC-based
      Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF), and the removal
      of cipher suites that use static RSA or DH key exchanges, the CBC
      mode of operation, or SHA-1.  The list of extensions that can be
      used with TLS 1.3 has been reduced considerably.

   The Canadian government treasury board have mandated that these old
   versions of TLS not be used.  [Canada]

3.  Removing Support

   [[This section can be removed upon publication - or maybe keep it?]]

   Support for TLSv1.0 has been removed by the July 2018 PCI deadline from the
   following standards, products, and services:

   o  3GPP 5G
   o  Amazon Elastic Load Balancing [Amazon]
   o  CloudFare [CloudFlare]
   o  Digicert [Digicert]
   o  GitHub [GIT]
   o  KeyCDN [KeyCDN]
   o  PayPal [paypal]
   o  Stripe [stripe]
   o  [[Numerous web sites...]]

   Many web sites have taken the action of including the deprecation of
   TLSv1.1 into their plans for deprecating TLSv1.0 for the PCI council
   deadline.  Support for TLSv1.1 has been removed by the July
   2018 PCI deadline from the following standards, products, and services:

   o  3GPP 5G Release 16
   o  Amazon Elastic Load Balancing [Amazon]
   o  CloudFare [CloudFlare]
   o  GitHub [GIT]
   o  PayPal [paypal]
   o  Stripe [stripe]
   o  [[Numerous web sites...]]

4.1.  Web

   Usage statistics for TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 on the public web vary, but
   have been in general very low and declined further with the
   impending PCI deadline to migrate off of TLSv1.0 by June 30, 2018.
   As of January 2018, [StackExchange] quoted 4 percent of browsers
   using TLSv1.0.

   The number of websites supporting TLS 1.2 is still growing (+0.4%),
   and has reached 92% according to sslpulse as of June 19, 2018.
   [SSLpulse] Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will thus not have a major
   impact on browser or web server implementations.

5.  SHA-1

   The integrity of both TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 depends on a running SHA-1
   hash of the exchanged messages.  This makes it possible to perform a
   downgrade attack on the handshake by an attacker able to perform 2^77
   operations, well below the acceptable modern security margin.

   Similarly, the authentication of the handshake depends on signatures
   made using SHA-1 hash or a not stronger concatenation of MD-5 and
   SHA-1 hashes, allowing the attacker to impersonate a server when it
   is able to break the severly weakened SHA-1 hash.

   Neither TLSv1.0 nor TLSv1.1 allow the peers to select a stronger hash
   for signatures in the ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify
   messages, making the only upgrade path the use of a newer protocol
   version.

   See [Bhargavan2016] for additional detail.

6.  Do Not Use TLSv1.0

   TLSv1.0 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.0 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Any version of TLS is more secure then TLSv1.0.  TLSv1.0 can be configured
   to prevent interception, though the highest version available is
   preferable.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,01}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,01}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,01} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.0.

7.  Do Not Use TLSv1.1

   TLSv1.1 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.1 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,02}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,02}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,02} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Any newer version of TLS is more secure then TLSv1.1.  TLSv1.1 can be
   configured to prevent interception, though the highest version
   available is preferable.  Support for TLSv1.1 is dwindling in
   libraries and will impact security going forward if mitagations for
   attacks cannot be easily addressed and supported in older libraries.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.1.

8.  Do Not Use SHA-1 in TLSv1.2

   [[This section was suggested in PR#2 by Hubert Kario.  We're not
   clear if the WG would like this draft to include this or not, so will
   ask the TLS WG at the appropriate time.]]

   SHA-1 as a signature hash MUST NOT be used.  That means that clients
   MUST send signature_algorithms extension and that extension MUST NOT
   include pairs that include SHA-1 hash.  In particular, values {2, 1},
   {2, 2} and {2, 3} MUST NOT be present in the extension.

   Note: this does not affect cipher suites that use SHA-1 HMAC for data
   integrity as the HMAC construction is still considered secure and
   when they are used in TLSv1.2 SHA-256 is used for handshake
   integrity.

9.  Updates to RFC7525

   [[Since RFC7525 is BCP195, there'll probably be some process-fun to
   do an update of that.  Formally, it may be that this document becomes

   a new part of BCP195 I guess, but we can figure that out with chairs
   and ADs.]]

   This documents updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.1 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

      Rationale: TLS 1.0 (published in 1999) does not support many
      modern, strong cipher suites.  In addition, TLS 1.0 lacks a per-
      record Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC-based cipher suites and
      does not warn against common padding errors.
   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

      Rationale: TLS 1.1 (published in 2006) is a security improvement
      over TLS 1.0 but still does not support certain stronger cipher
      suites.

   This documents updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.2 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347].

      Version 1.0 of DTLS correlates to version 1.1 of TLS (see above).

10.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates two older protocol versions for security
   reasons already described.  The attack surface is reduced when there
   are a smaller number of supported protocols and fallback options are
   removed.

12.  IANA Considerations
