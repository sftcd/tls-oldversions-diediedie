    <abstract>
      <t>This document [if approved] formally deprecates Transport Layer
      Security (TLS) versions 1.0 <xref target="RFC2246"/> and 1.1 <xref
      target="RFC4346"/> and moves these documents to the historic state.
      These versions lack support for current and recommended cipher suites,
      and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS
      now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLSv1.2 has been the
      recommended version for IETF protocols since 2008, providing sufficient
      time to transition away from older versions. Products having to support
      older versions increase the attack surface unnecessarily and increase
      opportunities for misconfigurations. Supporting these older versions
      also requires additional effort for library and product maintenance.</t>

      <t>This document updates the backward compatibility sections of TLS RFCs
      [[list TBD]] to prohibit fallback to TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1. This document
      also updates RFC 7525.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>[[Text in double-square brackets is intended
      to be fixed as the draft evolves. You've seen that we need to
      figure out the list of RFCs that this'd update in the abstract.
	  There is a repo for this at: https://github.com/sftcd/tls-oldversions-diediedie
	  - PRs (on the xml file) are welcome there.]]</t>

      <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 <xref target="RFC2246"/>
      and 1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/> were superceded by TLSv1.2 <xref
      target="RFC5246"/> in 2008, which has now itself been superceded by
      TLSv1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/>. It is therefore timely to
      further deprecate these old versions. The expectation is that TLSv1.2 will
      continue to be used for many years alongside TLSv1.3.</t>

      <t>TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 are also actively being deprecated in accordance
      with guidance from government agencies (e.g. <xref
      target="NIST800-52r2">NIST SP 80052r2</xref>) and industry consortia
      such as the Payment Card Industry Association (PCI) <xref
      target="PCI-TLS1"/>.</t>

      <t>The primary technical reasons for deprecating these versions
      include:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>They require implementation of older cipher suites that are no
          longer desirable for cryptographic reasons, e.g. TLSv1.0 makes
          TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA mandatory to implement</t>
  		  

          <t>Lack of support for current recommended cipher suites, especially
          using AEAD ciphers which are not supported prior to TLS 1.2.
		  Note: registry entries for no-longer-desirable ciphersuites remain in the 
		  registries, but many TLS registries are being updated
		  through <xref target="RFC8447"/> which
  		  denotes such entries as "not recommended."</t>

          <t>Integrity of the handshake depends on SHA-1 hash</t>

          <t>Authentication of the peers depends on SHA-1 signatures</t>

          <t>Support for four protocol versions increases the likelihood of
          misconfiguration</t>

          <t>At least one widely-used library has plans to drop TLSv1.1 and
          TLSv1.0 support in upcoming releases; products using such libraries
          would need to use older versions of the libraries to support TLSv1.0
          and TLSv1.1, which is clearly undesirable</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Deprecation of these versions is intended to assist developers as
      additional justification to no longer support older TLS versions and to
      migrate to a minimum of TLSv1.2. Deprecation also assists product teams
      with phasing out support for the older versions to reduce the attack
      surface and the scope of maintenance for protocols in their
      offerings.</t>

      <!-- duplication - already said in the bullet list above
      <t>Some TLS libraries are considering dropping support for TLSv1.0 and
      TLSv1.1 in upcoming releases. If products do not follow suit because the
      protocol has not been deprecated, multiple libraries may be needed for a
      very small number of deployments. While fixes have been developed to
      address the known vulnerabilities in TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, this may not
      continue if library support is eliminated for new releases.</t>

      <t>[[This draft is being written now so that the TLS WG chairs can just
      hit the "publication requested" button as soon as there is WG consensus
      to deprecate these ancient versions of TLS. The authors however think
      that deprecation now is timely.]]</t>

	<t>Industry has actively followed guidance provided by NIST and the PCI
Council to deprecate TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 by June 30, 2018.  TLSv1.2
      should remain a minimum baseline for TLS support at this time.</t>

      <t>Specific details on attacks against TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 as well as
      their mitigations are provided in <xref target="NIST800-52r2">NIST
			  SP800-52r2</xref>, RFC 7457 <xref target="RFC7457"/>  and other referenced RFCs. Although the attacks have been
      mitigated, if support is dropped for future library releases for these
      versions, it is unlikely attacks found going forward will be mitigated
      in older library releases.</t>

      <t>NIST for example have provided the following rationale,
			  copied with permission from <xref target="NIST800-52r2">NIST SP800-52r2</xref>, 
			  section 1.2 "History of TLS" (with references changed for RFC formatting).

	<list>
        <t>TLS 1.1, specified in <xref target="RFC4346"/>, was developed to
        address weaknesses discovered in TLS 1.0, primarily in the areas of
        initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
        Initialization vectors were made explicit to prevent a certain class
        of attacks on the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation used
        by TLS. The handling of padding errors was altered to treat a padding
        error as a bad message authentication code, rather than a decryption
        failure. In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC acknowledges attacks on CBC mode
        that rely on the time to compute the message authentication code
        (MAC). The TLS 1.1 specification states that to defend against such
        attacks, an implementation must process records in the same manner
        regardless of whether padding errors exist. Further implementation
        considerations for CBC modes (which were not included in <xref
        target="RFC4346">RFC4346</xref>) are discussed in Section 3.3.2.</t>
  <!--subcompact="yes" above isn't nice here - add lines -->

  		<t></t>

        <t>TLS 1.2, specified in <xref target="RFC5246">RFC5246</xref>, made
        several cryptographic enhancements, particularly in the area of hash
        functions, with the ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family
        algorithms for hash, MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF)
        computations. TLS 1.2 also adds authenticated encryption with
        associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.</t>

  		<t></t>
        <t>TLS 1.3, specified in <xref
        target="RFC8446">TLSv1.3</xref>, represents a significant
        change to TLS that aims to address threats that have arisen over the
        years. Among the changes are a new handshake protocol, a new key
        derivation process that uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key
        Derivation Function (HKDF), and the removal of cipher suites that use
        static RSA or DH key exchanges, the CBC mode of operation, or SHA-1.
        The list of extensions that can be used with TLS 1.3 has been reduced
        considerably.</t>

    <section title="SHA-1">
        <t>The integrity of both TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 depends on a running SHA-1
            hash of the exchanged messages. This makes it possible to perform a
            downgrade attack on the handshake by an attacker able to perform
            2^77 operations, well below the acceptable modern security margin.
        </t>

        <t>Similarly, the authentication of the handshake depends on
            signatures made using SHA-1 hash or a not stronger concatenation
            of MD-5 and SHA-1 hashes, allowing the attacker to
            impersonate a server when it is able to break the severely weakened
            SHA-1 hash.</t>

        <t>Neither TLSv1.0 nor TLSv1.1 allow the peers to select a stronger
            hash for signatures in the ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify
            messages, making the only upgrade path the use of a newer protocol
            version.</t>

      <t>TLSv1.0 MUST NOT be used. <!-- I didn't get the reason for this here: <xref target="RFC8174"/>.  -->
      Negotiation of TLSv1.0 from any version of TLS MUST NOT be
      permitted.</t>

      <t>Any other version of TLS is more secure then TLSv1.0. TLSv1.0 can be configured
      to prevent interception, though using the highest version available is
      preferable.</t>

      <t>Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
      ClientHello.client_version set to {03,01}. Similarly, servers MUST NOT
      send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to {03,01}. Any
      party receiving a Hello message with the protocol version set to {03,01}
      MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert message and close the
      connection.</t>

      <t>Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
      layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when sending
      ClientHello. Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that TLSPlaintext.version
      could be selected to maximize interoperability, though no definitive
      value is identified as ideal. That guidance is still applicable;
      therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value {03,XX} (including {03,00})
      as the record layer version number for ClientHello, but they MUST NOT
      negotiate TLSv1.0.</t>

      TLS MUST NOT be permitted.</t>

      <t>Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
      ClientHello.client_version set to {03,02}. Similarly, servers MUST NOT
      send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to {03,02}. Any
      party receiving a Hello message with the protocol version set to {03,02}
      MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert message and close the
      connection.</t>

      <t>Any newer version of TLS is more secure then TLSv1.1. TLSv1.1 can be
      configured to prevent interception, though using the highest version available
      is preferable. Support for TLSv1.1 is dwindling in libraries and will
      impact security going forward if mitigations for attacks cannot be
      easily addressed and supported in older libraries.</t>

      <t>Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
      layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when sending
      ClientHello. Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that TLSPlaintext.version
      could be selected to maximize interoperability, though no definitive
      value is identified as ideal. That guidance is still applicable;
      therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value {03,XX} (including {03,00})
      as the record layer version number for ClientHello, but they MUST NOT
      negotiate TLSv1.1.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Do Not Use SHA-1 in TLSv1.2">
		<t>[[This section was suggested in PR#2 by Hubert Kario. We're not 
				clear if the WG would like this draft to include this or not,
				so will ask the TLS WG at the appropriate time.]]</t>

        <t>SHA-1 as a signature hash MUST NOT be used. That means that
            clients MUST send signature_algorithms extension and that extension
            MUST NOT include pairs that include SHA-1 hash. In particular,
            values {2, 1}, {2, 2} and {2, 3} MUST NOT be present in the
            extension.</t>
        <t>Note: this does not affect cipher suites that use SHA-1 HMAC for
            data integrity as the HMAC construction is still considered secure
            and when they are used in TLSv1.2 SHA-256 is used for handshake
            integrity.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Updates to RFC7525">
      <t>[[Since RFC7525 is BCP195, there'll probably be some process-fun to
      do an update of that. Formally, it may be that this document becomes a
      new part of BCP195 I guess, but we can figure that out with chairs and
      ADs.]]</t>

      <t>This documents updates <xref target="RFC7525"/> Section 3.1.1
      changing SHOULD NOT to MUST NOT as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 <xref
          target="RFC2246"/>. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Rationale: TLS 1.0
          (published in 1999) does not support many modern, strong cipher
          suites. In addition, TLS 1.0 lacks a per- record Initialization
          Vector (IV) for CBC-based cipher suites and does not warn against
          common padding errors.
		  <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>

          <t>Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 <xref
          target="RFC4346"/>. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Rationale: TLS 1.1
          (published in 2006) is a security improvement over TLS 1.0 but still
          does not support certain stronger cipher suites.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This documents updates <xref target="RFC7525"/> Section 3.1.2
      changing SHOULD NOT to MUST NOT as follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 <xref
          target="RFC4347"/>. <vspace blankLines="1"/> Version 1.0 of DTLS
          correlates to version 1.1 of TLS (see above).</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document deprecates two older protocol versions for security
      reasons already described. The attack surface is reduced when there are
      a smaller number of supported protocols and fallback options are
      removed.</t>
